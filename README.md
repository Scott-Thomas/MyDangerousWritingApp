# My Dangerous Writing App

### My version of the Most Dangerous Writing App

* Extended the timeout to 10 seconds because sometimes you need to, you know, scratch your nose or something.
* Removed the call to openBrowser as I only use the app on its host machine about 50% of the time.

### Who made this?
